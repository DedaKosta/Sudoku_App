# Sudoku_App
Classic Sudoku Puzzle App

Version 1.0

Finished so far:
  - Overall style of the web app is mostly completed, some changes may still occur
  - Sudoku app is currently just a template, games are yet to be added
  - Working timer
  - Working check logic (not yet optimal)
  - Mod selection and cell logic

Not yet finished:
  - Number panel
  - New game (right now it just resets the board)

Version 1.1

I plan to implement some other features in this app:
  - Killer cages
  - Sandwich sudoku option
  - Diagonal sum
  - Arrow sudoku
  - Termo sudoku
  - Cell coloring
  - A page for setting sudokus
  - Maybe some more on the way
